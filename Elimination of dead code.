Example 1 :
Multiplication with powers of 2 can be replaced by shift left operator which is less
expensive than multiplication
a=a*16
// Can be modified as :
a = a<<4

Example 2 :
i = 1;																	
while (i<10)														
{																			
y = i * 4;
}


//After Reduction
i = 1
t = 4
{
while( t<40)
y = t;
t = t + 4;
}
